<<if $first_branch_choice is 'fred'>> 
When the stranger doesn't acknowledge your existence, you wonder if perhaps you should have chosen a friendlier figure. Your eyes dart towards the man on the sofa, he seems harmless enough. 
As though reading your mind, the stranger huffs and turns to you.

The man lets out an exaggerated sigh, and picks from a bowl of nuts.
@@.F;'Sure. I'll get over it. I always do.'@@
You see that his jaw is clenched, and his nostrils flare with each heavy breath.
@@.F;'I'm Fred. Not that you asked. I guess you've probably heard about me already.'
His voiced is strained, and for a passing moment, you wonder what it is that you've done to make this man so frustrated.

:: •	Shake his hand [First-Draft] {"position":"1150,1000","size":"100,100"}
He does so in one powerful movement, before letting it quickly go.

Ask him about:

[[•	What’s he’s reading?][$gar_conversation = 'book']]


:: •	Sit a on the armchair across from him? [First-Draft] {"position":"1400,625","size":"100,100"}
Beside the lumpy sofa is a broad armchair. You throw your weight into it with false confidence, and it makes a devastatingly loud fart noise as the air rushes out of the cushions beneath you. 
You lock eyes with the man with the book, your face heating. 
\<<if $first_branch_choice is 'fred'>>

[[‘What’s your name then?’ he asks.]]


:: •	Sit at a companionable distance? [First-Draft] {"position":"1275,625","size":"100,100"}
You sit in the middle of the sofa, close enough that you could put a hand on his thigh if you’d wanted to. You see his eyes dart from the page to your own leg. He may be uncomfortable with your proximity. You shuffle a little further away. 
\<<if $first_branch_choice is 'fred'>> 
FRED FIRST TEXT HERE
\<<elseif $first_branch_choice is 'judy'>>

\<<elseif $first_branch_choice is 'gareth'>>  
You look across the room to the rest of the party. There is a solemn looking man standing by the snack tables, continually glancing at Judy as if waiting for her to come over.

Judy and John are chatting in the kitchen with an easy familiarity.  
<</if>> 
It’s now that you realise just how empty the flat feels, with no personal effects, nothing that truly feels lived-in around you. 

You shift in discomfort as you realise the man has put down his book, you smile awkwardly as he turns to you. 

[[‘What’s your name then?’ he asks.]]


:: •	Sit on the sofa as far away as possible? [First-Draft] {"position":"1150,625","size":"100,100"}
As you sit down, the sofa cushions move under your weight, and the motion ripples over to the reading man. He clears his throat and shifts position, but doesn’t look at you. You’re thankful you sat at the very edge of the three-person sofa.

‘How that going for you?’

@@.G;‘I’m doing really well thanks.’@@

You nod vigorously to show that you’re listening, but he offers no further information. He flips back open his book.  

It seems you have failed to keep his interest.

Gareth looks about the room with cool observation.

It looks like that might be the only information he will proffer, but after a another beat he says: @@.G;‘Fred is probably my closest friend here.’@@
