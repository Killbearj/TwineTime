You cautiously take your first steps into the alleyway.

 I'm glad you came to your senses. Let's put that minor intrusion aside and refocus.

The lone streetlight in the centre of the alleyway flickers with a dying amber light, and the discarded pieces of debris casts ominous shadows on the grimy-laden brick walls.

"Mother," the master ninja assassin vampire says between sobs. He reaches out for you.

Okay, then you die.

What? You expected a big battle? A valliant effort to defeat the master of evil and darkness?

No. You die.

Actually, this ending feels a bit too easy. You've ruined my story, and you shouldn't get to just walk away easy. So you're not dead... yet. You see three objects within arm's reach, and you have time to grab one of them. 

Do you arm yourself with::

Your Health: $health

<<if $weapon is "rock">>
You throw your pathetic rock patherically and deal 3 damage. You no longer have a rock. Good job.
<<elseif $weapon is "scissors">>
 You go to shank the vampire and make a slight cut, dealing 10 damage. He is irritated and snaps the metal in two.
<<elseif $weapon is "paper">>
 Okay, well it turns out that was a page from the Bible. You read aloud from the page and do 1000 damage as the words sizzle against his skin. As you finish the passage, the page burns up.
